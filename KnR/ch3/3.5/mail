Yes, i think that will be good, because he is one of the early team
members.  Moreover, he was the first person to be involved in the
project.

I haven't been able to contact Animesh recently.  I will speak to
Ankit.

As a science college we have people who desire to write their own algorithms to solve specific problems they are working on, they sometimes find that just having one computer for crunching numbers will tie up their single computer for hours, days, or weeks before it converges on a solution! Using multi-threading the work can be done many times faster. We can call it true parallel processing.

Oh, OK.  I think the cluster in the cluster room will not be that
powerful, but the wfc can become a cluster for such purposes
temporarily, using liveCDs.  The cluster room cluster can be used for
practising/testing parallel programs, of course.

Yes, I think we can add these topics.

You mean, like, statistics about performance? I guess we can make a few graphs.
