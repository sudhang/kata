(09:54:52 PM) sudhang: i wanna see your kubrick inspired video, man
(09:54:59 PM) Vikram Kamat: lol
(09:56:11 PM) Vikram Kamat: during the "review", one guy got so confrontational man..i told him his definition of limit was too simplistic for a sophomore calculus class, and he asked me to "why don't you go up there now, and show me how its done?" :s
(09:59:30 PM) sudhang: LOL]
(09:59:45 PM) sudhang: did he have a hostile 'tone of voice'
(10:00:26 PM) Vikram Kamat: ya, he did
(10:00:32 PM) sudhang: whoa.. musta been racist
(10:00:39 PM) Vikram Kamat: i don't know, and i heard i wasn't the only one 
(10:00:53 PM) Vikram Kamat: no no, not racist..the other reviewers also got similar retorts
(10:01:01 PM) sudhang: ok :s
(10:01:07 PM) sudhang: musta had some financial trouble?
(10:01:15 PM) Vikram Kamat: i dont know all that :s
(10:01:27 PM) Vikram Kamat: he just didn't like being told how he could improve :s
(10:01:36 PM) sudhang: lol
(10:01:43 PM) sudhang: did anyone select him?
(10:02:37 PM) Vikram Kamat: i don't know, that's the job of the instructors, the TAs are just assisting them with the video taping and chipping in with some pearls of wisdom..haha :D
(10:02:52 PM) sudhang: lol
(10:02:55 PM) Vikram Kamat: but i don't think he's gonna get to teach this sem..maybe just a grading and assisting assignment
(10:03:17 PM) sudhang: is the pay less for these?
(10:04:19 PM) Vikram Kamat: the pay mostly depends on how far you are, in terms of academic progress..if you've passed all exams, you get paid the most..and yes, if you are teaching your own class, you get a little more, but this one's negligible
(10:06:35 PM) sudhang: passed all exams?
(10:06:36 PM) sudhang: oh
(10:06:43 PM) sudhang: even if you fail you get paid?
(10:06:46 PM) Vikram Kamat: ya, the qualifiers, comprehensive
(10:07:20 PM) Vikram Kamat: ya ya, of course, there are certain number of times you can take the exams, after which you are put on some "probation", where your advisor decides if you should still get another chance to continue etc.
(10:07:59 PM) sudhang: are these exams specific to the ta thing?
(10:08:19 PM) Vikram Kamat: so i don't know if you are kicked out of the program, but you are certainly not suppored by the department anymore..
(10:08:27 PM) Vikram Kamat: no no, the exams are your Phd exams...
(10:08:37 PM) sudhang: oh ok
(10:08:48 PM) sudhang: supported by the dept means?
(10:08:55 PM) Vikram Kamat: financial aid
(10:09:00 PM) Vikram Kamat: assistantship etc.
(10:09:28 PM) Vikram Kamat: so, mostly grad students are supported as teaching/research assistants..
(10:09:54 PM) sudhang: what do masters students assist
(10:10:11 PM) Vikram Kamat: so this TA training is just to make sure which TAs get to teach rightaway, which should just assist/grade/tutor etc.
(10:10:37 PM) Vikram Kamat: the same thing..but they get paid less than Phd students
(10:10:48 PM) sudhang: LOL
(10:10:52 PM) sudhang: that is so unfair!
(10:10:56 PM) Vikram Kamat: haha :D
(10:11:32 PM) Vikram Kamat: no, wait..its like this..a Phd student who has not passed any of his exams yet(mostly the first year) get paid the "masters level" stipend
(10:13:16 PM) Vikram Kamat: pass two qualifiers, you are thru to the next level..pass the comprehensive, next level...pass the oral comprehensive..final level..where you stay until you finish..unless you take too long to finish..
(10:14:48 PM) sudhang: which level are you in?
(10:14:53 PM) Vikram Kamat: final
(10:15:19 PM) sudhang: stud B)
(10:15:39 PM) Vikram Kamat: where i can be for two more years, maybe 6 months more if my advisor guarantees i will finish..uske baad out
(10:18:21 PM) sudhang: why would your advisor guarantee that you will finish?
(10:18:34 PM) sudhang: (i assume you mean the guarantee is made to some governing bodfy)
(10:18:48 PM) Vikram Kamat: to my department
(10:18:50 PM) Vikram Kamat: brb
(10:18:59 PM) sudhang: tyt
(10:30:26 PM) Vikram Kamat: ya, so he'd guarantee only if he's really sure i'm on the brink..or i'm done with all research except for some minor things and writing the thesis itself
(10:31:02 PM) Vikram Kamat: i don't know of any such cases, thogh..its just an official thing i read in the graduate student progress guideline
(10:32:49 PM) sudhang: god how can you even read those official guideline thigns?
(10:33:07 PM) Vikram Kamat: it was small..hehe
(10:33:15 PM) Vikram Kamat: 2-3 pages
